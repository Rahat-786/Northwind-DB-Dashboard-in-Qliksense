# Northwind-DB-Dashboard-in-Qliksense
The dashboard aims to display data of retail by displaying information on sales, employees, customers, products, and discounts. The major goal was to achieve the star schema data model which was quite tough as the data was de-normalized. SQL and queries files have been uploaded. All you need to do is just copy paste the code and run in MS SQL Server. In order to connect SQL with Qliksense, you need to assign a user on your sql.
